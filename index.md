## üë®‚Äçüíª Working Experience

### Freelance Developer _(Aug 2023 - Present)_

#### Project Summary
Developed an advanced automated trading bot that executes trades based on algorithmic analysis of real-time market data. This project underscores my proficiency in software development and financial technology, showcasing a fully automated system that adjusts dynamically to market conditions

#### Technical Contributions
- **Algorithm Design and Implementation**: Designed and programmed complex trading algorithms (Fibonacci Retracement based) to predict market movements and execute trades with high accuracy. Utilized _Python_ libraries such as _pandas_, _plotly_, _requests_, and _telebot_ to enhance data analysis and real-time interactions
- **System Architecture Development**: Engineered a complete system setup from the ground up, integrating _Python_ and _PostgreSQL_ for data handling and processing. Utilized _PL/pgSQL_ for efficient ETL processes
- **Data Management**: Implemented robust database solutions with _PostgreSQL_, ensuring data integrity and efficient handling to support complex trading operations
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Utilized Bybit's Crypto Exchange API to pull in live data and manage assets, enabling the bot to autonomously handle positions and adjust strategies in real time.
- **System Deployment and Management**: Deployed the trading bot on a _Linux_ server, optimizing system performance for 24/7 operation and ensuring stability
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuously monitored and optimized the system's performance, refining algorithms and improving responsiveness through adaptive strategy adjustments

#### Notable Achievements
- **Reliability and Efficiency**: Successfully built and maintained a trading bot that operates 24/7
- **Performance Improvement**: Dramatically enhanced trading efficiency by automating decision processes and executions, reducing the time to react to market changes. This automation enables the bot to capitalize on opportunities much faster than possible by a human trader, significantly improving trading outcomes
- **Professional Growth**: Advanced my technical skill set through extensive research and analysis of existing financial technologies and solutions, integrating and innovating upon best practices
